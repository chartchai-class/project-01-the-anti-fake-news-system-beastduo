                   SE331 Component-Based Software Development
Instruction

        You have already been set as a group of 3 people. If you cannot find a group of 3 people, please
let me know so I can set up a group for you. The mock data must be provided, and the web application
should be deployed to the server.

Brief Requirement

The Social Anti-Fake News System.

The Social Anti-Fake News system is a system that requires the wisdom of the cloud to help check fake
news. The users who heard the news can enter the news into the system, so the other users can see all
the news. The other users can look at the news and vote whether this news is fake or not, and put their
comments on why they think this is fake or not. The news is considered fake or not fake by the number of
votes. So on the list of news page, users can filter all news, fake news, or non-fake news.

So you have to develop this Social Ani-Fake News System. The system consists of the home page, which
will show the list of news and a filter to select what kind of news to see. The user must be able to select
the amount of news they want to see on each page. The details of each news story on this home page
must include the news topic, a short detail of the news, the status of the news, whether fake or not, the
name of the reporter, and the date and time of the report.

When the user selects the news that they want to see the details, the application should show the new
with the full details such as the news topic, a full detail of the news, the status of the news, whether fake
or not fake, the name of the reporter, the date of time of the report, and the image of the event (which
is in the html link form). From this page, the user can open the list of comments and the results that other
people have voted and commented on. In this part, the pagination must be applied. Or the user can click
on another page to vote on the news, the user has to vote whether the news is fake or not, and add a
comment or an image that you think can convince your choice (the link should be the URL link.) The data
should be stored in Storage management, as you cannot call the Post request to the server, but the data
you have entered must be shown on the comment lists. However, when you reload the page. The
comments can be removed as a simple single-page application.

You have to provide the mock data to be able to show all the pagination of your design, and the application
should be deployed in Vercel.



You should provide a video clip around 2-3 minutes to demo your application.

The submission should be provided in the Github repository, with the README.md, which specifies your
group name, member details such as your student id, and student names, the url of your video and the
URL of the deployed website.




                                                                                    Updated: 8th Aug 2025
You must enter the classroom and create a group.



You can log in to https://classroom.github.com/a/k6kO_4Go to access the GitHub classroom
workspace.

If you have any problems due to the platform, please let me know as soon as possible.

The grading criteria

        The grading criteria are provided in the Appendix A

Your score will be divided by the proportion of your distribution in the GitHub repository. So, plan
wisely. And do not forget to invite me to your GitHub repository.

Please update your readme.md to give me your information.

Project Submission

You have to submit your repository link (which you have already added me to be the visitor of your
GitHub)—the URL of the website you deploy. The submission must be before 26th August 11.59 pm. (as
your exam date will be on 28th August 12.00pm. I will read your information from your readme.md.
